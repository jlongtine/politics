I'm curious about how not simply the politicians we choose, but also the structures (mostly bureaucratic) have belief systems and worldviews. And I'm curious how that changes the conversation that our politicians have and the decisions they make.

That is, a lifetime bureaucrat, who isn't elected, but it appointed... has a viewpoint. "Good" or "Bad" is besides the point. But they have one. And the bureaucracy likely has one, as well. So, what is it? And how can the electorate change that viewpoint, if they so choose?

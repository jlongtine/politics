# Laws

## Refactoring laws

I occurs to me that we have accreted enormous complexity in our legal system. Enough complexity that the typical citizen could have no reasonable way of know the full scope of the legal code, and thus the likelihood that they are going outside of those bounds. This leads to rather unfortunate things, like the claim that the average American commits three felonies per days [1](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704471504574438900830760842?mg=id-wsj), [2](https://mic.com/articles/86797/8-ways-we-regularly-commit-felonies-without-realizing-it#.JmVQUe7hZ)
> Note: I need to look deeper into this, and check to see if it is factually correct. [This link](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22530/does-the-average-american-unwittingly-commit-three-felonies-a-day), and [this link](http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=88313) seems to suggest that it may not be. I would still argue that the complexity of our legal system has grown to such a size that it is difficult to know if you are commiting crimes. 

I have the following questions:

1. Can we reduce the complexity of our system by eliminating old laws, that are no longer valid or necessary?
1. Can we reduce the complexity of our system by strategically refactoring our system, and reducing the complexity of the rules?
1. Can we reduce the complexity of our system by forcing sunset provisions into each and every law, thereby requiring a look at laws on a regular basis?

## On the intent of laws

It seems to me that laws are passed in order to have some effect in/on the world and in/on the lives of the citizens of a country. Given that, I wonder if it might be of use to require that every law lays out the effect that it expects to have, and how it expects that effect to occur. In essence, I see the law as an assertion of a hypothesis about the way the world works.
